> Alex: "*I'm hoping for a helping hand with my business that will never be extended. I'm hoping that I get hired somehow for digital services or products. I have 2 years planned ahead for my business, and after this is uncertain. I can operate Sourceduty as a tiny business for now but I really want something bigger."*
