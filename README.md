> Alex: "Beyond programming and 3D models, I try to develop and share projects or concept ideas that impress people, initiate spending and inspire others. In addition to building custom GPTs, I currently practice creating new chemicals, car designs, house designs, business models, product designs, games and electronics. There are many other scientific areas that I try to utilize, but since scientific concepts and research don't pay for anything, I don't do this often."

> "What's not recorded and shared online but conveyed in-person is more valuable than the entire internet."
