Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality 

Security, privacy, and confidentiality are paramount in all Sourceduty communications. All team members are required to handle sensitive information, including personal data and proprietary business information, with the utmost care. Communication channels must be secure, and employees must follow all relevant data protection regulations and company policies. Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action. These principles are critical to maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, partners, and colleagues.

Reliable, clear, and accountable communication is essential to Sourceduty's operations. All employees are responsible for ensuring that their communications are accurate, well-documented, and adhere to established protocols. Messages should be concise, precise, and easily understood, avoiding any ambiguity that could lead to misunderstandings. Employees are expected to take ownership of their communications, particularly in situations where errors or miscommunications occur, and to address and correct these issues promptly to prevent further confusion.

Integrity in Visual and Digital Communication 

In today’s digital landscape, Sourceduty places great importance on the integrity of visual and digital communications. Employees must use digital tools, such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, responsibly, ensuring that all content created or shared is original, appropriate, and free from copyright infringement. Misleading users through altered images or manipulated content is strictly prohibited. All digital communications must reflect the values of accuracy, privacy, and confidentiality, upholding the trust that Sourceduty has established with its clients and stakeholders.

Legal and Ethical Compliance 

Sourceduty operates within a strict framework of legal and ethical compliance. All communication, especially in legal contexts, must be conducted with the highest level of care to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized or inappropriate communication in these contexts will be subject to investigation and corrective actions to maintain the integrity of the process. This policy applies universally, including across international borders, ensuring that all communications are lawful and ethical.

Handling Miscommunication and Conflicts 

Miscommunication and conflicts are inevitable, but how they are handled defines Sourceduty’s commitment to excellence. Open dialogue is encouraged as the primary means of resolving misunderstandings and disputes. Employees should clarify any points of contention early and engage in constructive discussions to resolve issues amicably. Intentional distortions or false misunderstandings to evade responsibility or mislead others are unacceptable and will be addressed through thorough investigations to maintain trust and integrity.
